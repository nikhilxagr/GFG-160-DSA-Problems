# Find Transition Point

# Given a sorted array, arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point, i.e., the first index where 1 was observed, and before that, only 0 was observed.  If arr does not have any 1, return -1. If array does not have any 0, return 0.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: index 3 is the transition point where 1 begins.

# Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: Since, there is no "1", the answer is -1.

# Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There are no 0s in the array, so the transition point is 0, indicating that the first index (which contains 1) is also the first position of the array.

# Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Index 1 is the transition point where 1 starts, and before it, only 0 was observed.

class Solution:
    def transitionPoint(self, arr):
        
        n = len(arr)

        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                return i

        return -1
