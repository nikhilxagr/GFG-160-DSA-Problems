# Four Elements

# Given an array A of N integers. You have to find whether a combination of four elements in the array whose sum is equal to a given value X exists or not.
 

# Example 1:

# Input:
# N = 6
# A[] = {1, 5, 1, 0, 6, 0}
# X = 7
# Output:
# 1

# Explantion:
# 1, 5, 1, 0 are the four elements which makes sum 7.
 


# Your Task:  
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find4Numbers() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns true if combination is found else false. Driver code will print 1 or 0 accordingly.


def find4Numbers( A, n, X):
    A.sort()

    for i in range(n - 3):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 2):
            
            target = X - A[i] - A[j]
            left = j + 1
            right = n - 1

            while left < right:
                curr_sum = A[left] + A[right]

                if curr_sum == target:
                    return True
                elif curr_sum < target:
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1

    return False
