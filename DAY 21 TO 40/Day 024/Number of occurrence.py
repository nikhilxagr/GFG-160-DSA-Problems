# Number of occurrence

# Given a sorted array, arr[] and a number target, you need to find the number of occurrences of target in arr[]

# Examples :

"""
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: target = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: target = 4 is not present in the given array so the output is 0.
Input: arr[] = [8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 12], target = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: target = 12 occurs 3 times in the given array so the output is 3.
