# Largest prime factor

# Given a number n, your task is to find the largest prime factor of n.

# Examples:

# Input: n = 5
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The prime factorization of 5 is just 5. Therefore, the largest prime factor is 5.
# Input: n = 24
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The prime factorization of 24 is 23×3. Among the prime factors (2, 3), the largest is 3.
# Input: n = 13195
# Output: 29
# Explanation: The prime factorization of 13195 is 5×7×13×29. The largest prime factor is 29

class Solution:
    def largestPrimeFactor(self, n):
        largestPrime = -1
        
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largestPrime = 2
            n //= 2
            
        i = 3
        while i * i <= n:
            while n % i == 0:
                largestPrime = i
                n //= i
            i += 2

        if n > 2:
            largestPrime = n

        return largestPrime
    
# Approach - In this approach, we first check for the factor 2 and then check for odd factors starting from 3. We keep dividing n by the factor until it is no longer divisible, and we update the largest prime factor found. Finally, if n is still greater than 2, it means n itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.
