# Next Permutation

# Given an array of integers arr[] representing a permutation (i.e., all elements are unique and arranged in some order), find the next lexicographically greater permutation by rearranging the elements of the array.
# If such a permutation does not exist (i.e., the array is the last possible permutation), rearrange the elements to form the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

# Examples:

"""
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 7, 5, 0]
Output: [2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 7]
Explanation: The next lexicographically greater arrangement of the elements in the array arr[] is [2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 7].

Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: This is the last permutation, so we return the lowest possible permutation (ascending order).

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]
Output: [1, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Explanation: The next lexicographically greater arrangement of the elements in the array arr[] is [1, 4, 2, 3, 5].

class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        i = n - 2

        # Step 1: Find first decreasing element from the right
        while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
            i -= 1

        # Step 2: Find element just larger than arr[i]
        if i >= 0:
            j = n - 1
            while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
                j -= 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

        # Step 3: Reverse the suffix
        arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
        return arr

# Approach:
# 1. Traverse the array from the end to find the first decreasing element (arr[i]).
# 2. If such an element is found, traverse again from the end to find the first element larger than arr[i] (arr[j]) and swap them.
# 3. Finally, reverse the subarray after index i to get the next permutation.
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
