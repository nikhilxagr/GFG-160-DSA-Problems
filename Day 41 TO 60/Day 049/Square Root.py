# Square Root

# Given a positive integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

# Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number.

# Examples:

# Input: n = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
# Input: n = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Since, 11 is not a perfect square, floor of square root of 11 is 3.
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 1 is a perfect sqaure, so its square root is 1.


class Solution:
    def floorSqrt(self, n):
        low, high = 1, n

        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if mid * mid == n:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < n:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return high
