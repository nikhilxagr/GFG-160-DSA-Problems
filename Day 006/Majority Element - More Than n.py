# Majority Element - More Than n/3

# Given an array arr[] consisting of n integers, the task is to find all the array elements which occurs more than floor(n/3) times.
# Note: The returned array of majority elements should be sorted.

# Examples:
"""

Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The frequency of 1 and 2 is 3, which is more than floor n/3 (8/3 = 2).
Input:  arr[] = [-5, 3, -5]
Output: [-5]
Explanation: The frequency of -5 is 2, which is more than floor n/3 (3/3 = 1).
Input:  arr[] = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no majority element.

class Solution:
    def findMajority(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        limit = n // 3
        
        freq = {}
        
        # Count frequency of each element
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        result = []
        
        # Check elements occurring more than n//3 times
        for num, count in freq.items():
            if count > limit:
                result.append(num)
        
        return sorted(result)
    
# Approach:
# 1. Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the array.  
# 2. Iterate through the frequency dictionary and collect elements whose count is greater than floor(n/3).
# 3. Return the sorted list of these elements.
