# Count pairs with given sum

# You are given an array arr[] and an integer target. You have to count all pairs in the array such that their sum is equal to the given target.

# Examples:
"""

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5], target = 6 
Output: 3
Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5), (7, -1) and (1, 5). 
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2 
Output: 6
Explanation: Pairs with sum 2 are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1).
Input: arr[] = [10, 12, 10, 15, -1], target = 125
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no pair with sum = target
