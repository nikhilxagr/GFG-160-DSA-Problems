# Search in a sorted Matrix

# Given a strictly sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and a number x. Find whether the number x is present in the matrix or not.
# Note: In a strictly sorted matrix, each row is sorted in strictly increasing order, and the first element of the ith row (i!=0) is greater than the last element of the (i-1)th row.

# Examples:

"""

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9], [14, 20, 21], [30, 34, 43]], x = 14
Output: true
Explanation: 14 is present in the matrix, so output is true.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9, 11], [14, 20, 21, 26], [30, 34, 43, 50]], x = 42
Output: false
Explanation: 42 is not present in the matrix.
Input: mat[][] = [[87, 96, 99], [101, 103, 111]], x = 101
Output: true
Explanation: 101 is present in the matrix.
