# Max distance between same elements

# Given an array arr[], the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element. If no element has two occurrences, then return 0.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: distance for 1 is: 5-0 = 5, distance for 2 is : 4-2 = 2, So max distance is 5.

# Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 2]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: maximum distance for 2 is 11-1 = 10, maximum distance for 1 is 4-2 = 2 ,maximum distance for 4 is 10-5 = 5, So max distance is 10.

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No element has two occurrences, so maximum distance = 0.

class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, arr):
        
        d = {}
        max_dist = 0
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            
            if arr[i] not in d:
                d[arr[i]] = i
                
            else:
                max_dist = max(max_dist, i - d[arr[i]])
                
        return max_dist
