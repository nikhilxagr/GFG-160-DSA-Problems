# Given the array arr[] of heights of certain buildings that lie adjacent to each other, Sunlight starts falling from the left side of the buildings. If there is a building of a certain height, all the buildings to the right side of it having lesser heights cannot see the sun.

# Find the total number of buildings that receive sunlight.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 8, 4, 11, 13]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Only the buildings with heights 6, 8, 11, and 13 receive sunlight; therefore, the output is 4.
  
# Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 1, 8, 3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Only buildings of height 2, 5 and 8 can see the sun, hence output is 3.
  
# Input: arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The first three buildings (height 3) receive sunlight, while the last building (1) is blocked. Hence, the output is 3.


class Solution:
    def visibleBuildings(self, arr):
        
        count = 0
        max_height = float("-inf")

        for height in arr:
            if height >= max_height:
                count += 1
                max_height = height

        return count
