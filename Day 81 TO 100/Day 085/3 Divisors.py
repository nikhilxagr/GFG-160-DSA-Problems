# 3 Divisors

# You are given a list of q queries, and for each query, an integer n is provided. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to n have exactly 3 divisors.

# Examples:

# Input: q = 1
#           query[0] = 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one number 4 which has exactly three divisors 1, 2 and 4 and less than equal to 6.
# Input: q = 2
#        query[0] = 6
#        query[1] = 10
# Output: 1
#         2
# Explanation: For query 1 it is covered in the example 1. query 2:There are two numbers 4 and 9 having exactly 3 divisors and less than 
# equal to 10.
