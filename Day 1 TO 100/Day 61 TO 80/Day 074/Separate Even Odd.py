# Separate Even Odd

# You are given a list numbers that contains integers. You need to return two lists, one of even numbers and other of odd numbers.

# Examples:

# Input: arr = [54, 43, 2, 5, 14, 17, 18, 9]
# Output: even: 54 2 14 18, odd: 43 5 17 19
# Input: arr = [5, 6, 7, 2, 4, 8, 9]
# Output: even: 6 2 4 8, odd: 5 7 9

def evenOdd(arr):
    
    even = []
    odd = []
    
    for i in arr:
        
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even.append(i)
        else:
            odd.append(i)
            
    return even, odd
